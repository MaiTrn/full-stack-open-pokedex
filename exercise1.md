I have chosen Dart (Flutter) as a language for the application. In Dart, the common tools for linting are `dart linter` and/or `flutter_lints`. For testing, we can use `flutter test` on `Appcircle, Travis or Cirrus`. Lastly, the most common CI building tool for Flutter is `Codemagic`. Besides Jenkins and Github Actions, we can also use some popular alternatives such as Codemagic, Bitrise, Appcircle, Cirrus, Travis, GitLab and CircleCI. Among all the tools listed, CircleCI, Cirrus, Codemagic and Bitrise are cloud-based environment; GitLab, AppCircle and Travis are both, depeneding on the use case. The information needed to decide if a setup is self-hosted or cloud-based is the purpose of that tool, is it created for convenience or for long-term use and scalability? Another factor to notice is the tool's expense and billing plan, does it charge you for build time or for the server? Lastly, if the setup requires you to maintain the hardware and patch the software by youself, then it is most likely a self-hosted environment; since most cloud-based ones requires little to no maintainence, as it is taken care of by external organizations. Choosing the right CI/CD system and tools can be difficult, and in the end, it is all based on our proposes.
